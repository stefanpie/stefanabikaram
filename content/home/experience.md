  The main work is on a project that aims to enable the usage of the mars organic molecule analyzer (MOMA) mass spectroscopy instrument at the ocean world of Europa with the goal of finding life outside of Earth. The instrument was designed for mars where it is possible to have a human in the loop controlling the instrument, but for usage at the outer planets, the constrained data link and link latency makes this impossible. The main task is developing algorithms for running on-board the flight computers to enable the instrument to run autonomously without direct human control. This particular position is involved with the designing and training of machine learning techniques, including neural networks, to classify mass spectra. The mass spectra will need to be identified as interesting or not interesting, and also be able to differentiate between inorganic and organic.
